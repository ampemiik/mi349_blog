            <h2>Welcome to The Little Things!</h2>
            <p>Hi! I am Miika Ampe, and I appreciate the little joys in life. No matter what obstacles have been thrown in my path this year, I have kept my spirits up by appreciating things that others may overlook; such as being in nature, or spending some time with friends. I created this blog to document some of those little moments that make me love life.</p>

            <h2>Forest Time - October 28, 2025</h2>

                <p>This day, I had a random headache, so I used that as an excuse to spend more time in the forest close to where I live. It’s autumn, so the fall leaves have been beautiful lately, so I can’t stop taking photos of all the scenery. I left my class and skateboarded across campus to the entrance to the forest. I knew I wanted to sit somewhere beneath the trees that had minimal sounds of civilization, like construction beeps and cars zooming on a street. Fairly quickly, I found one spot that looked like a perfect place to sit, but I could still hear nearby construction, so I kept walking. I ended up taking a new trail this time and found a perfect tree to sit under. So, I placed my longboard on the ground right in front of the tree and sat down on it. I got out my laptop and made progress on my homework. The colors of the fall leaves mixed with the lighting from the close-to-dusk-sun made the entire scene look unreal. I was working on assignments on my laptop with the sound of leaves and trees in the wind, birds chirping, and small animals bouncing through the leafy forest floor. Eventually, I had to leave because my phone, which was providing the hotspot, was running out of battery. On the way back, I had encounters with many deer, though all staying a safe distance, some seemed very interested in who I was and what I was doing there. It felt like a mini Disney Princess moment when I walked by them, and they didn’t move anything but their head to keep their eyes on me. Through this whole experience, I felt so connected with nature and disconnected from society. It was somehow both very relaxing and very exciting at the same time. I would recommend this to anyone, to do more than just touching grass.</p>

                    <p>My closest friend majors in art for her undergrad degree. This means she gets to take all sorts of art classes through all sorts of mediums and techniques. This semester, she is taking a class on photography. She is learning how to use a professional camera including adjusting all the settings on it manually instead of the camera doing it automatically. She received an assignment where she had to take pictures of people to capture who they are as a person, and she came up with the idea of taking photos of me. Her idea was to take pictures at the skatepark while I was skating, because skateboarding is a big part of who I am. I was very excited about this because I am not the type of person who takes pictures of themselves all the time, so I really only had one decent photo of myself, but that was outdated and with clothes I would never wear now. Most of the photos turned out to look amazing, which made my day because now I have multiple good photos of myself! They also really capture my essence through my outfit, skateboard, and graffiti. The process was very fun too, because we were just joking around and laughing, all while I was enjoying skating through the skatepark.</p>
